We are pleased to announce that the Bitcoin Association of Australia is taking a giant leap forward, joining forces with the Bitcoin Foundation.

Having established itself as the local custodians of this technology, the Bitcoin Association of Australia has decided to take advantage of new opportunities.
 
Going forward you will see the unification of world-class teams in a coordinated and collaborative effort, spanning continents. We remain steadfast in our mission to standardize, protect and promote Bitcoin. We are proud to continue fulfilling this mission with new partners.
 
With a new year and a new friend, the Bitcoin Association of Australia will also be making some changes. To start, our membership fees, portal and structure will be revamped, to make every member feel at home with both organisations. With the shift away from unilateral action, membership to the Association automatically guarantees membership with the Foundation.
 
Our Association is pleased to open membership to all Australians. There are also two available board seats which are currently unfilled. We look forward to fostering a great relationship with existing and new members, sponsors, press, and supporters. 

With this announcement our board has kicked into full gear. President Jason Williams, Vice President Pantelis Roussakis, Secretary Adam Poulton, Treasurer Max Kaye and board members Martin Bajalan, Bret Treasure and Tristan Winters are committed to making this association one that goes down in history.
 
An open call will take place through December. Anyone interested in getting involved as a member, volunteer, press contact or sponsor should contact: tristan.winters@bitcoin.asn.au

We look forward to seeing and hearing from you.
